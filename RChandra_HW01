Question 1: Use a programming language of your choice to save today's date to a variable. Then, include the date in the text below the code block.

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
current_date_variable <- Sys.Date()
```
# The Date
Today's date is `r current_date_variable`
