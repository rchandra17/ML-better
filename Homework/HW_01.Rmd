```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Question 1: Use a programming language of your choice to save today's date to a variable. Then, include the date in the text below the code block.

# Code:

```{r}
current_date_variable <- Sys.Date()
```

# The Date

```{r}
print(current_date_variable)
```

Today's date is `r current_date_variable`
